# CSL 203 - Object Oriented Programming Lab (in Java)

## LAB Cycle One

#### Basic programs using data types, operators, and control statements in Java.

* Java program to check whether a given number is prime or not.
* Java program to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
* Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string.
* Java program to reverse an given string.
* Java program to find the second smallest element in an array.
* Java program to multiply two given matrices.
* Java program to display the transpose of a given matrix.

## LAB Cycle Two

#### Object Oriented Programming Concepts constructors, inheritance, method overloading, method overriding, polymorphism and garbage collection.

* Java program to calculate the area of different shapes namely circle, rectangle, and triangle using the concept of method overloading.
* Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary()' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same. (Exercise to understand inheritance).
* Java program to create two Java classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from Employee class. Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary().
* Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides(). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides() that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures. (Exercise to understand polymorphism).
* Java program to illustrate Interface inheritance.
* Java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collector.
